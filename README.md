# Meme Generator

This project is dedicated on creating a Meme Generator. The website follows a short, but simple structure. The user will have six different options before generating the desired meme-- Inputing the URL for an image, text for the top, text size through range, text for the bottom, text size, and finally uploading an image directly from the users files. 

Through the simple implementation and planning for the creation of the meme the user has the opportunity to test their creativity. Moreover, the generator utilizes a form system where all sections of the form are optional, allowing the user to play around with the positioning and sizing of the text, or choosing if uploading and image through URL or from files directly. 

The idea originated while scrolling through Instagram and seeing numeroud accounts posting, sharing memes. Users would interact with the information presented by sending, commenting and liking the images. Therefore, I found the idea of giving the user the opportunity to build their own set of meme's could become an interactive and creative idea.
